<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p>Ping sends a text message to another phone. The other phone responds with its location. For this
    to work, Ping must be installed on both phones. To do this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install Ping on your phone.</li>
    <li>Install Ping on the other phone.</li>
    <li>Start Ping on both phones.</li>
    <li>Click "Start Service" on both phones.</li>
    <li>Click "Choose a Phone to Ping" on your phone.</li>
    <li>Choose the other phone. This will send a text.</li>
    <li>The other phone will show a prompt "Allow Ping Request?". Click "Yes".</li>
</ol>

<p>The other phone number will now be added to your "white-list" of contacts who can ping you.</p>

<p>Ping will also send text message reply with the location (latitude and longitude) of your phone.
This location will be shown by a marker on the map on the other phone.</p>

<p>If you click on the map marker, it will show the contact name and the time of the "ping".</p>

<p><b>Expanding the Map</b></p>

<p>To expand the map, click on the white arrows at the top right of the map. This will
    put the map at full size. You can minimize the map by clicking again on the white arrows.</p>

<p><b>Showing Location History</b></p>

<p>Ping normally shows only the most recent location of each contact. To show the full location
    history:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click the menu button at the top right.</li>
    <li>Select "Settings".</li>
    <li>Enable the setting "Show location history".</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently this only shows locations since the app started and the setting was enabled.
</p>

<p><b>Storing and Exporting Location History</b></p>

<p>You can store location history in a database and export it to CSV format. To do this, enable
the setting "Store location history in database". Subsequent ping replies will then be stored in the
database.</p>

<p>To export the database to CSV format, go to the "Location History" screen. Click
"Export Location History" to export to a file. Then click on "Email Exported File" to email the
file as an attachment.</p>

<p>To delete the location history, click "Delete Location History", then click "Yes".</p>

<p><b>Including Address in Replies</b></p>

<p>Ping normally sends only the latitude and longitude of your phone. You can also include the
    address by enabling the setting "Include address in ping replies".</p>

<p>The address is usually only available if your phone has an Internet connection. If there
is a problem getting the address, it will be sent as "Address: Unknown".</p>

<p><b>Ignoring Non-whitelisted Contacts</b></p>

<p>When a ping request is received from a non-whitelisted number, a prompt is shown
    asking whether to allow the request. You can disable this prompt
    by enabling the setting "Ignore ping requests from non-whitelisted contacts".</p>

<p>You can still add ping contacts by clicking "Choose Who Can Ping Me".</p>

<p><b>Starting and Stopping the Service</b></p>

<p>The service must be running for Ping to update the map when a ping reply is received.</p>

<p>To start the service, click the "Start Service" button. To stop it, press the "Stop Service"
    button.</p>

<p>To make the service start automatically, enable the setting "Start service
    when app starts".</p>

<p>To avoid accidentally stopping the service, you can enable the setting "Warn before stopping the
    service". This will show a prompt after you press the "Stop Service" button, to
    confirm if you really meant to stop the service.</p>

<p>Ping will give a notification when the service stops. You can disable this by turning off
    the setting "Give notification when service stops".</p>

<p><b>Choosing the Map Type</b></p>

<p>You can choose either Google Maps or OpenStreetMap for the map type. OpenStreetMap may allow for
    more tiles to be shown when there is no internet connection.</p>

<p>To do this, go to the settings screen and tap "Choose map type (requires restart)..." Then tap
    the desired map type. You have to restart the app before this takes effect. By default, Google
    Maps is selected.</p>

<p>In either case, the first time you use Ping, you should be connected to the internet, so that
    the map tiles can load in the first place.</p>

<p><b>Choosing ping contacts from the whitelist</b></p>

<p>By default, when you click "Choose a Phone to Ping", the list of all contacts is shown. You can
    instead show the "white-list" of Ping contacts by enabling the preference "Choose ping contact
    from whitelist".</p>

<p>This is useful to avoid pinging the wrong contact.</p>
