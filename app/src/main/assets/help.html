<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p>Ping sends a text message to another phone. The other phone responds with its location. For this
    to work, Ping must be installed on both phones. To do this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install Ping on your phone.</li>
    <li>Install Ping on the other phone.</li>
    <li>Start Ping on both phones.</li>
    <li>Click "Start Service" on both phones.</li>
    <li>Click "Choose a Phone to Ping" on your phone.</li>
    <li>Choose the other phone. This will send a text.</li>
    <li>The other phone will show a prompt "Allow Ping Request?". Click "Yes".</li>
</ol>

<p>The other phone number will now be added to your "white-list" of contacts who can ping you.</p>

<p>Ping will also send text message reply with the location (latitude and longitude) of your phone.
This location will be shown by a marker on the map on the other phone.</p>
